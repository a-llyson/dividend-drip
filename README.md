# dividend_drip
From www.investor.gov:<br />
"The ex-dividend date for stocks is usually set one business day before the record date. If you purchase a stock on its ex-dividend date or after, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend."


**Dividend Drip** ðŸ’§ determines which combination of stocks will create the most profitable dividend return. Given a budget, it will search all stocks with an ex-dividend date in the future. It shows the estimated dividend return at the latest payout date of the stocks in the group.
